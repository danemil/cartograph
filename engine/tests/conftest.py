    ``~/.cartograph`` holds ``registry.json``, ``watch.toml``,

    the real one:

    * ``Registry()`` defaults there, and ``incremental.get_data_dir()``
      constructs one internally — so any test touching data-dir resolution
      both read and wrote the registry of whoever ran the suite. That put
      pytest tmp paths into a developer's home directory, and made those
      tests depend on machine state: a developer with a registered repo
      could get different results from one without.
    * ``daemon`` built its config/PID/state paths from ``Path.home()``.

    Autouse and unconditional: an opt-in fixture would silently stop
    protecting a test the day someone forgets to request it.
